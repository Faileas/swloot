Strip out CLI -- its clunky and doesn't offer enough discoverability

New CLI
   /swloot <-- Opens GUI
   /swloot [item] <--Performs need roll
   /swloot greed [item] <--Performs greed roll
   /swloot award [item] Person need/greed <--Awards item

Scrap '/swloot award' guessing items and what not; it doesn't interact well with the loot windows

Everything else goes into a GUI

ALTS

Keep a table
Add character to table
Goto main
Add character to table
Goto main
Loop until there is no main, or character is already in the table

Timidge -> Raam -> Ellone
{[Timidge]} -> Raam
{[Timidge][Raam]} -> Ellone
Done

Timidge -> Raam -> Ellone -> Timidge
{[Timidge]} -> Raam
{[Timidge][Raam]} -> Ellone
{[Timidge][Raam][Ellone]} -> Timidge
Done --> print a nasty error message, then just use Timidge as the main

All functions should take current character and convert to main as appropriate.  
Store the current character *and* the main for printing purposes
