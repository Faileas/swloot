I'm uploading two revisions today.  r12 has seen my usual suite of solo tests, although there were a few edge cases I didn't get around to.  r13 has not seen anything, but its limited entirely to the synchronization code, so the basic functionality should still be fine.  Still, though, it might be best to start off with r12 just in case.

There were a lot of changes in r12.  Most of the functionality described in Issue 4 [http://code.google.com/p/swloot/issues/detail?id=4] should be in place, *except* that there is no startraid command yet.  It still saves what raid you're in between loads.  By and large, there is no change to the actual usage, even though the underlying behavior has seen significant tweaking.

Delete your saved variable file before updating.  It behaves oddly in a couple places when old data and new data meet.  Theoretically, you can get by without the purge if you're feeling chancy.

Also, it now saves a date when the raid was created, and when a bad raid is loaded will tell you which raid is associated with your current instance ID.  So you can chose more human readable raid names than Don seemed fond of [ie, Kara3 instead of 12562730163]

Finally, r8 added a new command you may find useful.  "disqualifyRoll Name" does exactly what you'd expect: remove a person's roll from consideration.  If done during the roll, it will continue on as normal, and you can use award to assign the loot to whoever actually rolled highest.  However, if done after the roll you need to use awardDirect, because the addon doesn't remember if it was a need roll or a greed roll.  The output is something along the lines of "Ellone wins the roll; Faileas still has a need available", indicating that Faileas would have won on a need, but Ellone would have won on a greed.  There is very little raid feedback when using this feature, so feel free to use it to screw Clinton out of lewt, he probably won't even notice.

If you encounter any trouble, I'll be on AIM.
