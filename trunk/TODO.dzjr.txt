Dennis's list of things he wants to see happen

(1) Get synchronization working
(2) Make it at least passibly "thread safe" [one roll at a time, please]
(3) Rethink raid naming.  Untie the name with the table location to de-emphasize naming, and associate the instance ID with the raid so you can select raids that way as well.  Maybe a date field?
(4) Shard rolls, pref w/ interface
(5) More output options [notably summarizing to party/self regardless of group composition]
